    <h2>  What the different of Map, Filter ,forEach and find
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The map() method loops through each element in array and calls the provided function for each element. This method creates a new array and doesn’t alter the original array.</li><p></p>

    <li>
        filter must be required conditions.The filter() method in JavaScript creates a new array with the elements that satisfies the provided condition. based on condition it would be given by an array.filter show all expected output
    </li> <p></p>

    <li>
        forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.

    </li><p></p>

    <li>The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array element. Remember filter return all element but find only fast one.</li>

</ul>

<h2>different of localStorage , sessionStorage and Cookies</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that the localStorage stores data with no expiration date, while the sessionStorage stores data from one session. 
        
    On The Other Hand Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.</li>
</ul>

<h2> What is Event Loop.How does it work</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and  the Callback Queue or Message Queue. 

        The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous 
        programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a 
        few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
    </li>
</ul>
